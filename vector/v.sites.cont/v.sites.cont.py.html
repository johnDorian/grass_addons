<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
<em>v.sites.cont</em> Calculates the contributing area of each point within a vector.
</p>
<p>
This module will calculate the contributing area for each point in a vector layer. In addition, the addon will also calculate the statistics of raster maps within the contributing area.
</p>

<p>
Caluculation of the contributing area is performed using the teh flow direction map produced using <em><a href="r.watershed.html">r.watershed</a></em> and is required to determine the contributing area which is undertaken using the <em><a href="r.wateroutlet.html">r.wateroutlet</a></em> modulde.
</p>
<p>
It is recommended that the points within the vector layer are snapped to the stream using the <em><a href="r.stream.snap.html">r.stream.snap</a></em> module to ensure the points are aligned correctly for the calculation. However, this is not required and the contributing area can still be determined for locations not aligned with streams.
</p>
<p>
This module will calculate the contributing area for each point, and if additional raster maps are provided, it will use the contributing area as a <b>raster</b> to mask the other raster maps and calculate the statistics for these maps.
</p>
<p> This module calculates statistics using two different methods: </p>
<p>
<b> Continous maps </b>
This option is for maps with continuous values and will calculate the minimum, mean, etc for this map and add columns to the inputted vector map accordingly.
</p>
<p>
<b> Categorical maps </b>
This option will calculate the area statistics for these maps. This is useful for landclass style maps. It will create a column in the vector layer for each type of unique value in the map and determine the area within of each type within the sub-catchment.
